\section{Introduction}

Octa.Space project is a distributed computing platform which aims to provide the transparent and easy-to-use mechanismes and interfaces
to solve the tasks by utilizing CPU and GPU resources of the nodes connected around the world.

A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements
that appears to its users as a single coherent system.\cite{distributedsystems}
It's very important to have the system with unified interfaces and coherent behaviour which provides a single entry point for the end users interaction.

The project goals are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide easy to use interface for describing and executing the tasks
    \item Control and planning of the consumed resources
    \item Provide playground for experiments with task distribution
    \item Utilize the power of blockchain technology to make most things transparent, including payments, tasks distribution and assigments
\end{itemize}

The sort of tasks the project is focused on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Machine Learning
    \item CGI rendering
    \item Digital image processing
    \item Other tasks/fields which require massive compuation power to be solved
\end{itemize}
