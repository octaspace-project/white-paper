\section{Tasks}

Task is a set of actions which should be performed on the node.
Also task must contain the list of system requirements which is necessary for its execution.

To describe the task the following type specification must be used:

\begin{minted}{erlang}
-type xpu() :: <<"cpu">> | <<"nvidia">> | <<"amd">>.

-type step() :: #{
    <<"name">>    => binary(),
    step_module() := step_args()
}.

-type task() :: #{
    <<"name">>                   => binary(),
    <<"xpu">>                    := xpu(),
    <<"xpu-cpu-fallback">>       := boolean(),
    <<"xpu-n">>                  := pos_integer(),
    <<"xpu-fallback-wait-time">> => pos_integer(),
    <<"pending-ttl">>            => pos_integer(),
    <<"ttl">>                    => pos_integer(),
    <<"spaces">> := #{
        xpu() := binary()
    },
    <<"steps">> := [step()]
}.
\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}
    \item name - human readable description of the task
    \item xpu - the type of execution unit, can be \textbf{cpu}, \textbf{nvidia} or \textbf{amd} if task require GPU
    \item xpu-cpu-fallback - in case if xpu is set to use GPU but no node with GPU found during \textbf{xpu-fallback-wait-time} time task will assigned to node with CPU only
    \item xpu-n - minimum amount of the required execution units eg. amount of GPUs or CPU cores
    \item pending-ttl - task will be canceled if no one node will found during \textbf{pending-ttl} period
    \item ttl - maximum task execution time
    \item spaces - the list of specific isolated environments per xpu type
    \item steps - the list of actions which should be performed on the node
\end{itemize}

More detailed specification may be found in the project OSS\cite{oss} documents.

Task can be described using both JSON or YAML formats.
