\section{Blockchain}

The Aeternity technologies are used as blockchain backbone for the project.
It was chosen because of the rich features like oracles, state channels and so on.

The project uses dedicated chain.
Initially it's a plan to utilize the blockchain only as a payment system.
But in the future all the things like tasks management, rewards, etc will be implemented as smart contracts.
